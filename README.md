## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sulaiman (Sony) Lateef, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at Brandeis University studying Computer Science. I am a passionate programmer
who enjoys challenging projects in Python and Java. A goal of mine is to work on software or technology that can help others. 

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an NBA data analytics project that utilizes the API web to analyse interesting trends in NBA stats
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning model tools in additon to improving my foundational knowledge of Python, Java, C++, HTML, and CSS
